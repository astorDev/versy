# Talking Shell Scripts: An Architectural Journey

<img src="./shell-puzzle-creature-1.jpg" style="width:300px;" alt="Prompt: Cartoonish animal trying to connect shell scripts like a puzzles">

I always have a love-hate relationships with shell. When I just started programming I was pissed off whenever a tutorial told me to use terminal. What is it? 80s? Then, I've started appreciate it as the most basic language for any IT specialist. Then, I've somewhat liked it. I knew basics about shell, I've even written few `.sh` files. And one day an idea for CI versioning tool came up to me. So I've created a [repository](https://github.com/astorDev/versy). The journey has began.

## The journey

The mission was following: Script accepts CI run, branch and returns date-based version: `2024.109.112.9999-branch-name`. On the main branch no suffix is appended `2024.109.112.9999`. As a DRY maximalist I've decided that suffix creation logic seems to be reusable, so I've decided to create two files: `suffix.sh` and `calver.sh`. The first version looked like this:

`suffix.sh`

```sh
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo ""
else
    NORMALIZED=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
    echo "-$NORMALIZED"
fi
```

`calver.sh`

```sh
SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)
echo $(date +'%Y.1%m.1%d').$RUN$SUFFIX
```
This simple version works fine. But only when all the environments are set.

## The ~~Orc's~~ logs

The first simple version works just fine. Until it don't. What happened to me was trying to run it from GitHub action. Suddenly, I'm not sure if environment variables were assigned, passed from a script to script and so on. I needed logs. But simply `echo`ing logs would screw up returned value. Here's what me, stackoverflow, and chatGPT thought about the problem.

- Me: Shouldn't there be a `return` keyword?
- StackOverflow: You can only return integers up to 255
- Me: Bad. ChatGPT what do you think?
- ChatGPT: Save the echo in variable, `grep` and `awk` the output
- Me: *Trying...*. Seems fragile. Other options?
- StackOverflow: Echo with >&2. Return exit status. Share variable
- Me: *Had bad time sharing variables*. WTF is `>&2`?
- ChatGPT: This outputs to second (error) stream - stderr.
- Me: Is there any other stream? *Hoping there's a stdlog*
- ChatGPT: Well, stdout, stdin, stderr.
- Me: Oh, stderr isn't red by default. Let's go with it!

`suffix.sh`:

```sh
echo >&2 "Calculating suffix (BRANCH='$BRANCH')"

if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo >&2 "Branch is main. Returning no suffix"
    echo ""
else
    echo >&2 "Normalizing '$BRANCH'".
    NORMALIZED=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
    echo "-$NORMALIZED"
fi
```

`calver.sh`:

```sh
echo >&2 "Calculating version (RUN='$RUN')"
SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)
echo >&2 "Received suffix '$SUFFIX'"
echo $(date +'%Y.1%m.1%d').$RUN$SUFFIX
```

## The ~~Erebor~~ remote call

And this works fine, too. While you are in the folder root. But I wanted the scripts to be callable remotely by github url like:


```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/main/architecture/v3/.sh | sh
``` 
> *Assuming the caller assigned variables like `export BRANCH=feature/one RUN=99 `

The problem with that is this line:

```sh
SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)
```

The `suffix.sh` will be `not found` on a caller's machine. So we need to pack both `suffix` and `calver` logic in the file downloaded by the caller. But I still want both `suffix` and `calver` to be callable separately. To do it let's:

1. Put `suffix` and `calver` in the same file (simply `.sh`). Wrap their logic with functions. Replace file calls with function calls.

> ** You can also use `function suffix()` syntax, but it's not universally compatible. In particular, it's not compatible with GitHub action shell.

```sh
suffix() {
    echo >&2 "Calculating suffix (BRANCH='$BRANCH')"
    
    if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
        echo >&2 "Branch is main. Returning no suffix"
        echo ""
    else
        echo >&2 "Normalizing '$BRANCH'".
        NORMALIZED=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
        echo "-$NORMALIZED"
    fi
}

calver() {
    echo >&2 "Calculating version (RUN='$RUN')"
    SUFFIX=$(suffix) # calling function instead of file
    echo >&2 "Received suffix '$SUFFIX'"
    echo $(date +'%Y.1%m.1%d').$RUN$SUFFIX
}
```

Now we also need a way to actually call one of the function. Let's treat first function argument as the called function name. First script argument is available via `$1`. So the `.sh` end is:

```sh
ACTION=$1
echo >&2 "Executing action '$ACTION'"
$ACTION
```

Now a remote caller will be able to generate a new version using something like this:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/main/.sh | sh -s calver
```

## Fighting ~~Smaug~~ complexity (Bonus)

I was pretty happy with what we got in the previous version. But I miss the ~~good all days~~ having file per logic. So how can we store logic in separate file but "pack" them together? That is what `source` is about. We can do `source suffix.sh` in `.sh` and the `suffix` function will be available there. But the code above will only work locally. We need to source function conditionally either from a remote source or by relative path. Here's the function I come up with to achieve it:

> I use `.` for sourcing as it's universally compatible. `source` doesn't works with GitHub shell  
> ** I create a temp `./x.sh` file as it's the only way I found for `curl`ing remote script in GitHub shell.

```shell
sourcing() {
    if [ "$SOURCING_URL" = "" ]; then
        echo "Sourcing ./$1.sh by relative path"
        . ./$1.sh
    else
        echo "Sourcing $SOURCING_URL/$1.sh"
        curl -sSL "$SOURCING_URL/$1.sh" > ./x.sh
        . ./x.sh
    fi
}
```

So a remote call will be accessible with something like this:

```sh
export SOURCING_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/main/architecture/v4 && curl -sSL ${SOURCING_URL}/.sh | sh -s calver
```
