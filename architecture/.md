# Talking Shell Scripts: An Architectural Journey

<img src="./shell-puzzle-creature-1.jpg" style="width:300px;" alt="Prompt: Cartoonish animal trying to connect shell scripts like a puzzles">

I always have a love-hate relationships with shell. When I just started programming I was pissed off whenever a tutorial told me to use terminal. What is it? 80s? But, I still learned the basics, as there was no way out. I started appreciating it as the "IT common language". Then, I somewhat liked it, so I even wrote a few `.sh` files. 

One day, an idea for CI versioning tool came up to me. So I created a [repo](https://github.com/astorDev/versy). The journey began.

## The journey

The mission was following: Script accepts CI run number, branch and returns date-based version: `2024.109.112.9999-branch-name`. If the branch is main, no suffix appended: `2024.109.112.9999`. The suffix logic seemed to be reusable, so, this is what my first take on the problem was:

`suffix.sh`

```sh
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo ""
else
    NORMALIZED=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
    echo "-$NORMALIZED"
fi
```

`calver.sh`

```sh
SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)
echo $(date +'%Y.1%m.1%d').$RUN$SUFFIX
```

### The ~~Orc's~~ logs

The first version worked just fine. Until it didn't. I started using this scripts in GitHub action. Suddenly, I wasn't sure if environment variables were assigned, passed from a script to script, and so on. I needed logs. But simply `echo`ing logs would screw `SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)` up. The council of stackoverflow, chatgpt and me was convened.

- Me: How about `return`? Is there something like this in shell?
- StackOverflow: Only for integers up to 255
- Me: Bad. ChatGPT any idea?
- ChatGPT: Save the echo in variable, `grep` and `awk` the output
- Me: *Trying...*. Seems fragile. Other options?
- StackOverflow: 1. Echo with `>&2`. 2. Return exit status. 3. Share variable
- Me: *Had bad time sharing variables*. WTF is `>&2`?
- ChatGPT: This outputs to second (error) stream - stderr.
- Me: Is there any other stream? *Hoping there's a stdlog*
- ChatGPT: Well, there are stdout, stdin, and stderr.
- Me: Oh, stderr isn't red by default. Let's go with it!

`suffix.sh`:

```sh
echo >&2 "Calculating suffix (BRANCH='$BRANCH')"

if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo >&2 "Branch is main. Returning no suffix"
    echo ""
else
    echo >&2 "Normalizing '$BRANCH'".
    NORMALIZED=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
    echo "-$NORMALIZED"
fi
```

`calver.sh`:

```sh
echo >&2 "Calculating version (RUN='$RUN')"
SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)
echo >&2 "Received suffix '$SUFFIX'"
echo $(date +'%Y.1%m.1%d').$RUN$SUFFIX
```

### The ~~Erebor~~ remote call

This worked fine, too. While you are in the scripts folder. But I wanted the scripts to be callable from anywhere by url like this:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/main/architecture/v3/.sh | sh
``` 
> *Assuming the caller assigned variables like `export BRANCH=feature/one RUN=99 `

But the problem was again with this line:

```sh
SUFFIX=$(sh suffix.sh)
```

For a remote call the `suffix.sh` would be `not found`. So we needed to find a way to "pack" both `suffix` and `calver` logic for the remote caller. But I wanted both of them to remain callable. Here's what I did:

1. Put `suffix` and `calver` in the same file (simply `.sh`). Wrapped their logic with functions. Replaced file calls with function calls:

> ** You can also use `function suffix()` syntax, but it's not universally compatible. In particular, it's not compatible with GitHub action shell.

```sh
suffix() {
    echo >&2 "Calculating suffix (BRANCH='$BRANCH')"
    
    if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
        echo >&2 "Branch is main. Returning no suffix"
        echo ""
    else
        echo >&2 "Normalizing '$BRANCH'".
        NORMALIZED=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g')
        echo "-$NORMALIZED"
    fi
}

calver() {
    echo >&2 "Calculating version (RUN='$RUN')"
    SUFFIX=$(suffix) # calling function instead of file
    echo >&2 "Received suffix '$SUFFIX'"
    echo $(date +'%Y.1%m.1%d').$RUN$SUFFIX
}
```

2. Accept the called action as the first script argument via `$1`:

```sh
ACTION=$1
echo >&2 "Executing action '$ACTION'"
$ACTION
```

With that a remote caller would be able to execute `calver` with

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/main/.sh | sh -s calver
```

### Fighting ~~Smaug~~ complexity (Bonus)

I was pretty happy with the version. But I still missed the ~~good all days~~ having file per logic. I figured out that `source` is the way to "pack" together logic from different files. But the remote calls problem still remained. Essentially, the final "package" should be able to source files from both relative path and url. So I've come up with a function that does just that:

> `.` is used instead of `source` for increased compatibility. In particular, with GitHub shell.  
> Creating the Temp `./x.sh` file is also used as the GitHub shell compatible approach

```shell
sourcing() {
    if [ "$SOURCING_URL" = "" ]; then
        echo "Sourcing ./$1.sh by relative path"
        . ./$1.sh
    else
        echo "Sourcing $SOURCING_URL/$1.sh"
        curl -sSL "$SOURCING_URL/$1.sh" > ./x.sh
        . ./x.sh
    fi
}
```

Now when I put `suffix` and `calver` function in their own files I could just source them in `.sh`:

```sh
sourcing suffix
sourcing calver

ACTION=$1
echo >&2 "Executing action '$ACTION'"
$ACTION
```

And a remote caller would be able to use it pretty adequately like this:

```sh
export SOURCING_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/main/architecture/v4 && curl -sSL ${SOURCING_URL}/.sh | sh -s calver
```

I was happy enough with this approach. There's seemed to be no battle left. So, [the version](https://github.com/astorDev/versy/architecture/v4) is where the journey finished.
