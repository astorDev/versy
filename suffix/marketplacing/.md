# Marketplacing a Shell GitHub Action

<img src="./ferret-in-bazaar.jpeg" height="300"/>

I tend to think there is the best coding routine:

- Start a branch.
- Implement and test changes.
- Merge changes to the forked branch.

With that in mind, I was outlining my work on a custom github action. I began to study their docs. [Creating an action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action#testing-out-your-action-in-a-workflow): Use a workflow file for tests. Noted. [Publishing to the marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace#about-publishing-actions): Repository must not contain a workflow file. 

Wait. 

This is frustraiting. I want to have both marketable and testable respository. I was perplexed. Eventually, I decided to have two: the marketplace repository and the testable "motherland" repository.

## Scripts from the Motherland

The github action was part of the CI versioning project, called [versy](https://github.com/astorDev/versy). The action goal was to generate versioning `suffix`, based on the current branch. So, the story begins with me creating a branch called `marketplacing-suffix`. 

I defined the actual logic in `suffix/marketplacing/.sh`:

```sh
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo ""
else
    echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g'
fi
```

And verified it straight away with a local script `suffix/marketplacing/test.sh`:

```sh
export BRANCH=feature/one && echo "BRANCH=$BRANCH => SUFFIX='$(sh .sh)'"
export BRANCH=main && echo "BRANCH=$BRANCH => SUFFIX='$(sh .sh)'"
```

The next step, was to test the script by a remote call. A Github public repository file content is accessible by `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{repository-name}/{branch}/{path-to-file}`. So using `curl` I came up with the first version of a test workflow `.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml'
      - 'suffix/marketplacing/**'

jobs:
  remote-call:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/$BRANCH/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh
        env:
          BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

After `push`ing to the current branch (`marketplacing-suffix`), the workflow successfully `echo`ed `marketplacing-suffix`.

## Motherland action

The next step was to actually create a reusable github action. I copied the workflow script to the action. But it needed some modifications. The `remote-call` just logs the suffix, while the GitHub action has to write its output for future usage. So I updated the script to:

1. Write the call result in a variable:

```sh
SUFFIX=$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/${BRANCH}/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh)
```

2. Put it to the GitHub output:

```sh
echo "suffix=$SUFFIX" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

There was one more unobvious problem with the script, however. Let's say an external repository used the action. Because of the `BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}` the script path will be constructed with `external-repo-branch-name` like this:

```url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/external-repo-branch-name/suffix/marketplacing/.sh
```

The path just wouldn't exist in the `versy` repository. The solution I came up with was to separate the versioning branch from the suffix script branch:

```yaml
run: | 
  SUFFIX=$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/${SCRIPT_BRANCH}/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh)
  echo "suffix=$SUFFIX" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
env:
  SCRIPT_BRANCH: ${{ inputs.script-branch }}
  BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

After the addition of the required metadata, the action looked like this:

```yaml
name: 'Suffix'
description: 'Generate Suffix based on the current branch'

inputs:
  script-branch:
    description: 'Name of the branch in suffix repository'
    required: false
    default: 'main'
outputs:
  suffix:
    description: 'The generated suffix'
    value: ${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      shell: bash
      run: | 
        SUFFIX=$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/${SCRIPT_BRANCH}/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh)
        echo "suffix=$SUFFIX" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      env:
        SCRIPT_BRANCH: ${{ inputs.script-branch }}
        BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

Now, it was time to test the action. An action can be called from a workflow by `{username}/{repository-name}/{action-folder-path}@{branch-name}`. The `branch-name` could not be provided dynamically so I grudgingly hard-coded the current branch:

```yaml
uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@marketplacing-suffix
```

At least, I could set `script-branch` dynamically. Appending a verification step, I got the following workflow job:

```yaml
local-action:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - id: suffix 
      uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@marketplacing-suffix
      with:
        script-branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    - run: echo "Suffix is '${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}'"
```

## The Marketplace Repository

This was a time to merge the `marketplacing-suffix` branch to `main`. However, I didn't remove the merged branch, so that `local-action` would still work. Instead, I started a new branch called `marketplaced-action` and verified the action can now be called from the `main` branch:

```yaml
local-action:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@main
      with:
        script-branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    - run: echo "Suffix is '${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}'"
```

This worked. I was comfortable starting the marketplace repository. I created the `suffix` repository with the default `README.md` only. Started the branch `init`. Created a trivial wrapper in `action.yml`:

```yaml
name: 'Versy Suffix'
description: 'Generate Suffix based on the current branch'

inputs:
  script-branch:
    description: 'Name of the branch in suffix repository'
    required: false
    default: 'main'
outputs:
  suffix:
    description: 'The generated suffix'
    value: ${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@main
      with:
        script-branch: ${{ inputs.script-branch }}
```

It was time for testing. But, as you may remember, the marketplace repository could not contain a workflow. So I pushed the action to the `init` branch and wrote the verification job in the motherland repository:

```yaml
marketplace-action:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      uses: astorDev/suffix/@init
    - run: echo "Suffix is '${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}'"
```

This worked and I merged `init` branch in the `suffix` repository to `main`. Than, I verified it once again, updating the motherland workflow:

```yaml
uses: astorDev/suffix@main
```

That concluded the first stage. Both marketplace and motherland repository actions were verified. I merged the `marketplaced-action` to `main`.

## Publishing to the marketplace

Meanwhile, in the marketplace repository appeared a banner suggesting publishing it to the marketplace.

In fact, it led to the GitHub release form with marketplace opt-in. However, it turned out to be impossible to create a release without having a tag. So, I started by pushing a tag:

```
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

After that, I filled out the publication form:

<img src="./marketplace-publish-form.png" width="700" />

Hit `Publish the release`. And the action appeared in the marketplace.

<img src="Marketplaced.png" width="700" />

This loaded the default README by GitHub. I've updated the README, merged the update to the `main` and fortunatelly it automatically updated the Marketplace page. Now, it looked more like how it looks [today](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/versy-suffix):
