# Marketplacing a Shell GitHub Action

<img src="./ferret-in-bazaar.jpeg" height="300"/>

This all started with me wanting a CI versioning system. I needed a GitHub action. In the GitHub marketplace. I also wanted the action's logic to be reusable elsewhere. With that in mind, I've opened my machine and start coding.

> Based on a true story.

## Overcoming GitHub Marketplace Limitations

I have a strict routine: git flow, constant and thorough testing, small steps. There is [quite a few](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace#about-publishing-actions) limitations for a marketplace action that makes the routine harder, in particular:

1. Repository must **not** contain any workflow files.
2. Repository must contain a single action.
3. The action's metadata file (`action.yml` or `action.yaml`) must be in the root directory of the repository.

My envisioned repository started to fall apart. My ambition was to create a comprehensive project with a few cohesive actions and scripts. The rules not only block that but also make it impossible to **fully** test the action. A rich repository was stuck as a goal in my head. A poor project was manifesting itself from the limitations. I was looking for a workaround. So, I've decided to have two:

- The "Motherland" Repository. The actual logic, workflows and tests, and basically everything important lays here.
- The "Marketplace" Repository. The tiniest wrapper around the action from the motherland repository with no purpose other than satisfying marketplace terms.

## Scripts from the Motherland

For the story, I'll focus on the small part of a [bigger picture](https://github.com/astorDev/versy), called `suffix`. The goal was to have a version suffix generator, based on the current branch.
So, I forked a branch called `marketplacing-suffix` and started coding. I put logic in `suffix/marketplacing/.sh`, for the sake of reusability:

```sh
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo ""
else
    echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's/\//-/g'
fi
```

And verified it straight away with a local script `suffix/marketplacing/test.sh`:

```sh
export BRANCH=feature/one && echo "BRANCH=$BRANCH => SUFFIX='$(sh .sh)'"
export BRANCH=main && echo "BRANCH=$BRANCH => SUFFIX='$(sh .sh)'"
```

A Github public repository file content is accessible by `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{repository-name}/{branch}/{path-to-file}`. So a repository script can be called using `curl`. Based on that I've created the first version of a test workflow `.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml'
      - 'suffix/marketplacing/**'

jobs:
  remote-call:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/$BRANCH/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh
        env:
          BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

I pushed all the changes to the current branch (`marketplacing-suffix`). The workflow successfully `echo`ed `marketplacing-suffix`.

## Motherland action

Next step was to actually create a reusable github action. The `remote-call` simply `echo`es the suffix, while the action has to output it for future usage by other scripts. So I've updated the script to

1. Write the call output in a variable:

```sh
SUFFIX=$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/${BRANCH}/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh)
```

2. Put it to the GitHub output:

```sh
echo "suffix=$SUFFIX" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

There was one more unobvious problem with the script, however. In the workflow, I've constructed the script path using `${{ github.ref_name }}`. It worked well for me, but for a another action user `${{ github.ref_name }}` will be `whatever-feature/i-am-working-on` which just wouldn't exist in my repository. So the suffix branch and script branch should be separated, allowing a remote user to pick the script branch, like this:

```yaml
run: | 
    SUFFIX=$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/${SCRIPT_BRANCH}/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh)
    echo "suffix=$SUFFIX" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
env:
    SCRIPT_BRANCH: ${{ inputs.script-branch }}
    BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

After the addition of the required metadata, the action looked like this:

```yaml
name: 'Suffix'
description: 'Generate Suffix based on the current branch'

inputs:
  script-branch:
    description: 'Name of the branch in suffix repository'
    required: false
    default: 'main'
outputs:
  suffix:
    description: 'The generated suffix'
    value: ${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      shell: bash
      run: | 
        SUFFIX=$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astorDev/versy/${SCRIPT_BRANCH}/suffix/marketplacing/.sh | sh)
        echo "suffix=$SUFFIX" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      env:
        SCRIPT_BRANCH: ${{ inputs.script-branch }}
        BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
```

An action can be called from a workflow by `{username}/{repositoryname}/{action-folder-path}@{branch-name}`. This is hardly compatible with git-flow, since the `branch-name` couldn't be provided dynamically. So I grudgingly hard-coded the current branch:

```yaml
uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@marketplacing-suffix
```

At least, I could use current `script-branch`. Adding a step to `echo` the suffix output, I got:

```yaml
local-action:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - id: suffix 
      uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@marketplacing-suffix
      with:
        script-branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    - run: echo "Suffix is '${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}'"
```

## The Marketplace Repository

Before moving the marketplace repository I needed to get back to the git flow. I've merged the changes as is in the `main`. However, I didn't remove the `marketplacing-suffix` branch, so that `local-action` would still work. Next, I started a new branch called `marketplaced-action`. The first step was to verify the action can now be called from the `main` branch, so I updated `local-action` to:

```yaml
local-action:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@main
      with:
        script-branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    - run: echo "Suffix is '${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}'"
```

This worked. I was comfortable starting the marketplace repository. I created it from GitHub with the default README file. Created a branch `init` and started coding. Actually, the only thing I did was a trivial wrapper over the motherland action `action.yml`:

```yaml
name: 'Versy Suffix'
description: 'Generate Suffix based on the current branch'

inputs:
  script-branch:
    description: 'Name of the branch in suffix repository'
    required: false
    default: 'main'
outputs:
  suffix:
    description: 'The generated suffix'
    value: ${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - id: suffix
      uses: astorDev/versy/suffix/marketplacing@main
      with:
        script-branch: ${{ inputs.script-branch }}
```

Then it was time for testing. But, as you may remember, the marketplace repository could not contain a workflow. I pushed the action to the `init` branch. And added the required check to the motherland repository.

```yaml
marketplace-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: suffix
        uses: astorDev/suffix/@init
      - run: echo "Suffix is '${{ steps.suffix.outputs.suffix }}'"
```

When this worked I was ready to merge `init` to the `main` branch in the `suffix` repository. And as a final step, I've updated `marketplace-action` to `use` `astorDev/suffix@main`, verified it, and merged the `marketplaced-action` branch to the `main` in `versy` (motherland) repository.

## Publishing to the marketplace

After merging `init` to `main`. A banner suggesting publishing to the marketplace appeared.

I've followed the link, actually hoping to get away with requiring access to the action via the branch name. But the release form required me to pick a tag. So first, I needed to push a tag:

```
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

After that, I filled out the publication form:

Hit `Publish the release`. And the action automatically appeared in the marketplace.

Remember, that was the default README by GitHub. After, that I updated the README in the `main` branch and it was automatically updated in the Marketplace. After the update the action's marketplace looked a lot like [how it looks today](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/versy-suffix):
