# Marketplacing a Shell GitHub Action

## Goal

## Inputs

- You can have multiplace actions per repository. **But** you can't marketplace such repository. In a marketplaced repository you need to have exactly one action.
- You can't have workflows in a marketplaced repository.

## Steps

- [x] Start a branch `marketplacing_suffix` 
- [x] Create `.sh`
- [x] Test with `test.sh`
- [x] Test with `.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml` with `remote_call` job
- [x] Test with `.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml` with `action_call` job
    - [ ] Create the action based on `remote_call`
        - [ ] Wrap the remote call and output in to GITHUB_OUTPUT
            - provide id (for output)
            - add shell
            - use `script_branch`
        - [ ] Meta information
            - [ ] Input `script_branch`
            - [ ] Output `suffix`
    - [ ] Create `local_action` workflow step with current `marketplacing_suffix` suffix
- [ ] Merge the code in `main` (don't delete the existing branch)

Snapshot of `.github/workflows/suffix-marketplacing.yaml`:

```yaml

```

- [ ] Create branch `suffix-marketplaced`
- [ ] Test workflow with `main` branch
- [ ] Create repository `suffix` with default README.md
- [ ] Start `init` branch in `suffix` repo
- [ ] Create a wrapper action in the repository
- [ ] Test the repository action via versy workflow `marketplaced_action`
- [ ] Merge `init`.
- [ ] Test the action from main
- [ ] Merge `suffix-marketplaced`
- [ ] Publish the `suffix` to GitHub marketplace.
