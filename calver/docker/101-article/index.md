# Making Versioning Easy: A Smarter Approach to Software Releases

> Discover how CalVer—a time-based versioning technique—can simplify your release process, and learn how to automate it in a GitHub Actions CI pipeline for Docker image tagging.

Today, most software projects rely on **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** to manage releases. While SemVer is widely adopted, it comes with its own set of challenges: constant manual tracking of version numbers, arbitrary decisions about release sizes, and the mental overhead of deciding whether a change is a 'major,' 'minor,' or 'patch.'

But what if there was a versioning style that didn’t require you to spend time overthinking releases—one that was both easy to remember and informative? Enter **Calendar Versioning (CalVer)**, a simpler, time-based approach that takes the guesswork out of versioning. In this article, we’ll explore how CalVer works and demonstrate its power by automating it in a GitHub Actions CI pipeline to tag Docker images.

## Wrapping Up!

Versioning doesn’t have to be complicated. While SemVer has been the go-to approach for years, it often comes with unnecessary overhead—forcing developers to manually track versions and arbitrarily decide release sizes. CalVer, on the other hand, offers a simpler, time-based alternative that eliminates the guesswork and keeps your versioning process clean and intuitive.

In this article, we explored how CalVer works, why it’s a great fit for modern software projects, and even used it in a GitHub Actions CI pipeline to tag Docker images. Whether you’re managing a fast-paced project or just looking to streamline your release process, CalVer might be the versioning strategy you’ve been missing.

The Github Action we used is part of a project called Versy. Check it out [here on GitHub](https://github.com/astorDev/versy). Don't hesitate to give it a star! ⭐
