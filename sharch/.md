# Shell Architecture (ShArch)

Things I learned while deciding on the architecture:

- Bash functions can return **only** integers up to 255
- There's 3 streams of data in shell: stdin, stdout, stderr

I'm creating a software product with few sh scripts coordinating between each other. I want called scripts to log their actions and return values. When I call a parent script I want to get called script logs and assign the return value to a variable. 

I see following approaches:
- Logging to stderr and returning value to stdout
- Echoing everything together, then grepping return value
- Assigning variables in the called script

Is there any other options? Which options is considered the best practice and why?

Additional options from ChatGPT options:
- Logging to files
- Using named pipes
