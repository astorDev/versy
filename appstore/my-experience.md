# Releasing a Flutter IOS App: My AppStore Story

My app [Finrir]() was recently granted a spot among 1.8 million other AppStore apps. I have even released a few updates afterward. But I went a surprisingly long journey to get here. In this article I'll share my experience and shed light on what one can expect when publishing an app to AppStore.

## First Attempt: Tasky

## Releasing Finrir

## Releasing Updates

## This is where we now

This is my experience with AppStore, so far. I couldn't say it was very friendly, but it wasn't hostile either. The future holds a lot more releases, so let's see what else I'll figure out about AppStore releases. I'll probably write another article if something interesting will pop up ... for now, claps are appreciated! üëè
